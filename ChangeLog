	* ANSIColor.pm: croak() instead of die() on AUTOLOAD failure to
 	get the right error text, fixed a bunch of typos in the
 	documentation, added a quote.

Wed Dec 10 12:05:36 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.01 released.

	* ANSIColor.pm (color): Carp::croak() isn't predeclared, so it
	needs parens around its argument.  This bug will only show up in
	versions of Perl >5.004_04 since up until then strict.pm imports
	Carp which predeclares the function.

Sat Nov 29 01:58:44 1997  Russ Allbery  <rra@Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.00 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Now gets version information from the module, has
	the correct rules to build a distribution.

	* test.pl: Comments trimmed, minor test modifications.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed my e-mail address, fixed to deal correctly
 	with trailing delimiters when EACHLINE is being used, die()
 	changed to croak() if the caller uses an invalid attribute name,
 	getting $VERSION from RCS updated to my current method, source
 	detabified.

	* test.pl: Added test for EACHLINE with trailing delimiters.

Mon Feb 17 13:54:44 1997  Russ Allbery  <rra@Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 0.9 released.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed the runtime error message to start with an
 	uppercase letter, reworked the documentation considerably
 	including adding more comparison between the two interfaces,
 	fixing some formatting bugs, fixing a typo, adding more
 	diagnostics, and generally being more verbose.

Wed Jan  8 11:52:37 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 0.8 released.

	* test.pl: Fixed the test numbering in the BEGIN block.

	* test.pl: Reformatted and commented to fit my programming style.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.8] Changed the method by which
 	$VERSION is set so that it will always have two digits after the
 	decimal point.

	* test.pl: New file.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.7] Changed the codes so that reset is
 	always consistantly "\e[0m".

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.6] Added $EACHLINE and support to
 	colored() for it so that attributes can be reset around every
 	newline (or other line delimiter -- we're flexible).  Documented
 	this as well.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.5] Changed implementation of the
 	constants to autoloaded subs, added the $AUTORESET variable for
 	use with the constants, and documented this.

Sat Dec  7 21:46:25 1996  Russ Allbery  <eagle@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.4] Added POD documentation.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.3] Added constant forms, modified to
 	allow a space-separated string of attributes to be passed to
 	color() and colored(), added Zenin to the credits.

Wed Dec  4 12:08:58 1996  Russ Allbery  <eagle@cyclone.Stanford.EDU>

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.2] Changed return syntax and check for
 	the null attribute string.

	* ANSIColor.pm: New file.
